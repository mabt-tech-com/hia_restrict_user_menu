The Restrict User Menu application in Odoo allows administrators to restrict access to specific menus for designated users. This ensures that users only see the menu items relevant to their roles, enhancing security and simplifying the user interface. By implementing this feature, organizations can streamline navigation and protect sensitive information within the Odoo system.
